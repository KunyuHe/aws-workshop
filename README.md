Please follow the steps below in preparation for the Amazon Web Services Workshop:

* Click Create an Account  and follow the ensuing instructions. Note you will have to: 
  * Enter Payment Information (I will teach you how to be sure you are not paying for things you do not intend to pay for).
  * Note that part of the sign-up procedure involves receiving a phone call and entering a PIN using the phone keypad. 
* Request funding through AWS Educate 
  * Go to this page: https://www.awseducate.com/Registration
  * Select Student, then follow the instructions and fill out the ensuing forms.
* Install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI): https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html
